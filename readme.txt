Wordpress plugin that shows dropdowns for State and City Select for woocomerce

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

WordPress 4.0  or greater
Woocommerce 2.2 or greater
PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

- Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click `Add New`.
- Search for "Departamentos y Ciudades de Colombia para Woocommerce", install and activate.
- Available [@Github](https://github.com/saulmoralespa/departamentos-y-ciudades-de-colombia-para-woocommerce).


= Manual installation =

[See wordpress codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation)


= Updating =


Automatic updates should work like a charm; as is the best practice, back up should be undertaken before updates.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.


This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->Plugin Name screen to configure the plugin
4. (Make your instructions match the desired user flow for activating and installing your plugin. Include any steps that might be needed for explanatory purposes)


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= It includes all the cities of the 32 departments?

Only major cities of each department.

= Something else you have not told me?

* Bogotá is not included as a state, because it is not discarded
* In the shipping area so you can impose rules you must first add the department in the field of states

= They are not loading the states or departments at the checkout to what is due?
